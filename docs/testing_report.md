# Call-VU Management Studio Testing Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing process for the Call-VU Management Studio application, including identified issues and recommended fixes.

## Testing Process
1. Repository was successfully cloned from GitHub
2. Dependencies were successfully installed using `npm install`
3. Attempted to run the development server using `npm run dev`

## Issues Identified

### 1. Import/Export Mismatch in StarRating Component

**File:** `src/components/form/StarRating.jsx`
**Line:** 3
**Current Code:**
```jsx
export default function StarRating({ maxScale = 5, onChange, value }) {
```

**Issue:** The component is exported as a default export, but imported as a named export in FormChat.jsx.

**Referenced in:** `src/pages/FormChat.jsx`
**Line:** 10
```jsx
import { StarRating } from '../components/form/StarRating';
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Change the export in StarRating.jsx to a named export:
```jsx
export function StarRating({ maxScale = 5, onChange, value }) {
```

### 2. Missing useSessionManager Hook

**File:** `src/components/utils/sessionManager.jsx`
**Issue:** The file exports several functions (`createSession`, `updateSession`, `getSession`, `processRules`), but does not export a `useSessionManager` hook that is imported and used in FormChat.jsx.

**Referenced in:** `src/pages/FormChat.jsx`
**Lines:** 15, 37
```jsx
import { useSessionManager } from '../components/utils/sessionManager';
const { addMessage, getMessages } = useSessionManager();
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Add a React hook called `useSessionManager` to the sessionManager.jsx file:

```jsx
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useSessionManager() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  
  // Load messages from storage on component mount
  useEffect(() => {
    try {
      const storedMessages = localStorage.getItem('chat_messages');
      if (storedMessages) {
        setMessages(JSON.parse(storedMessages));
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error loading messages:", error);
    }
  }, []);
  
  // Add a new message to the chat
  const addMessage = useCallback((text, sender) => {
    const newMessage = {
      id: Date.now(),
      text,
      sender,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    setMessages(prevMessages => {
      const updatedMessages = [...prevMessages, newMessage];
      // Store in localStorage
      try {
        localStorage.setItem('chat_messages', JSON.stringify(updatedMessages));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error saving messages:", error);
      }
      return updatedMessages;
    });
  }, []);
  
  // Get all messages
  const getMessages = useCallback(() => {
    return messages;
  }, [messages]);
  
  return {
    addMessage,
    getMessages
  };
}
```

## Additional Observations

1. The application appears to be a React-based conversational health intake system with multiple interaction modes (chat, voice, avatar).
2. The codebase is well-structured with clear separation of components, pages, and utilities.
3. The application uses modern React patterns and libraries including React Router, React Hook Form, and various UI components.
4. The GitHub repository has been successfully set up, but there were pending tasks to provide connection guidelines to users, which has now been completed.

## Conclusion

The application cannot currently run due to the identified import/export mismatches. These issues need to be fixed before the application can be properly tested and deployed. The recommended fixes provided above should resolve the immediate issues preventing the application from starting.
